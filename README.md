# ETL with Visual Studio and SSIS: Tech Reseller Company
This project is an example of how to use the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Visual Studio and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to extract, transform, load and analyze content from a tech reseller company.

## Description
The tech reseller company has a database with information about their products, customers, and orders. The goal of this project is to extract data from this database, transform it into a format that can be analyzed, and load it into a data warehouse for further analysis.
The ETL process is divided into three parts: Extract, Transform, and Load. In the Extract stage, data is extracted from the source database using SSIS. In the Transform stage, the data is transformed using SSIS to conform to the desired format. In the Load stage, the transformed data is loaded into a data warehouse for analysis.
The project includes a sample SSIS package that demonstrates the ETL process. The package uses SQL Server as the source database and loads the data into a data warehouse using SSIS.
